"open source software" - Initial results were noisy. Fixed by adding stopword removal and phrase search.
"data science" - Too many results. Improved ranking by adjusting TF-IDF weighting.
"CS conference papers" - Retrieved irrelevant documents. Improved term expansion using stemming.
"deep learning vs machine learning" - No distinction. Improved handling of multi-word phrases.
"computer vision research" - Low recall. Improved indexing by adding synonyms.

Additional Queries Tested:
multiple stopwords - Queries with just stopwords returned poor results initially. Stopword filtering was added to improve performance.
long queries > 10 words - were initially noisy. Query term weighting was adjusted to emphasize important words.
Random single words like "university"
